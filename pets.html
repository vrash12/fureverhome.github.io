                    Mingming was rescued from the streets of Manila. She was malnourished and needed immediate care. After weeks of rehabilitation at our shelter, she found a loving home with the Dela Cruz family. Now, she spends her days napping in sunny spots and playing with her favorite yarn ball.

                    Millie was abandoned in a local park and found by one of our volunteers. She was shy and scared at first but soon warmed up to the staff and other pets at the shelter. After a few months, she found her forever home with the Johnson family, where she now spends her days playing with her new siblings and enjoying long walks.
